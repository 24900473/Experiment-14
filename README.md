## Pytest Python program for Fibonacci Series 
# Aim:To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and test the test cases using Pytest. 
# Algorithm: 
Step 1: Write the python program for Fibonacci Series.
Step 2: Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested
should have assert keyword at the beginning.
Step 3: Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_fib.py”.
Step 4: Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is
saved and type “pytest test_fib.py” and run it.
Step 5: Stop the program.
